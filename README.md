Building a hamburger with `CSS` only

## Getting started

Clone repository 

```
git clone https://github.com/scriptjumper/hamburger-build.git
```

Navigate into directory 

```
cd hamburger-build
```

Use any service/package to execute/launch the `index.html` file in your browser.

I personally like to use `lite-server` which you would need to install `NodeJS` and `NPM` to use this package.
